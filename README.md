Project builder is a utility made to make workspaces for projects easier to create. Right now it is only available in python3 (live with it) and still in alpha. It is an interactive and rather straightforward piece of software and it is command-line based.

How to use it:

Place the "build.py" file in the directory/folder you want to create your project folder in. i.e. if you place it in "/home/user/development/python" a project folder created using Project-Builder will be created at "/home/user/development/python/your_project_folder". 

It can at the moment build these kinds of projects:
¤ Web projects (HTML,CSS,JS)
¤ More coming soon...
 
At the moment it is a standalone program but I have had some plans on making a module of it as well so it can be integrated into other programs.
I'm planning on porting it to other languages as well when it becomes a bit more mature. 

I'm kinda new to github so forgive me if I mess something up :-)

Please help me improve it!
